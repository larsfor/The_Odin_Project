# README

This is the final project for the Ruby on Rails path on The Odin Project.
We are here tasked with building a Facebook clone, where we are implementing the following:

* User sign in (through Devise)
* Friend requests
* Posts 
* Possibility to like posts
* Possibility to comment on posts (polymorphic)
* Have a "Timeline" feature
* Sign in through OmniAuth (not fully implemented - so not working at the moment)
* Have a mailer to send a welcome email
* Heroku deployment


TODOs:
* Add some JavaScript or TurboStreams
* Add photos
* Have the mailer as a part of the Controller, not the Model
* Style it up more nicely
