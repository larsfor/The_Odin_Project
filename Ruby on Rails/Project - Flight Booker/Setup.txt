You want to build a site similar to a private Eventbrite which allows users to 
create events and then manage user signups.

A user can create events. A user can attend many events. An event can be attended 
by many users. Events take place at a specific date and at a location (which you 
can just store as a string, like “Andy’s House”).

_Event_
-date:datetime
-location:string
-title:string
-description:text

has_many :event_attendings, foreign_key: :attended_event_id
has_many :attendees, through: :event_attendings, source: :event_attendee
belongs_to :creator, class_name: "User"

_User_
-name:string
-username:string
-password:string

has_many :event_attendings, foreign_key: :event_attendee_id
has_many :attended_events, through: :event_attendings
has_many :hosted_events, foreign_key: :creator_id, class_name: "Event"

_Event_attending_
belongs_to :event_attendee, class_name: "User"
belongs_to :attended_event, class_name: "Event"
