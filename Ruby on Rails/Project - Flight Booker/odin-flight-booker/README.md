## Project: Flight Booker

In this project, we're tasked with creating a flight booker.
Here we're learning how to create advanced forms, with for example nested forms. 

This project is a part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) - where we're learning how to create many-to-many models in Ruby on Rails.
