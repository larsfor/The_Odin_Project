## Project: Private Events

In this project, we're tasked with creating a site where you can create events.
You can create the event, or attend as many events you want. 
This project is a part of (https://www.theodinproject.com)[The Odin Project] - where we're learning how to create many-to-many models in Ruby on Rails. 

The layout is very much inspired from the "A Twitter Clone" by Web-Crunch.
If you're interested, you can watch it here: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gUysPm64a4&t=1s)[Let's Build: A Twitter Clone With Ruby on Rails] - it's a bit dated, but he recently made an updated version if you want to look at that one instead.
