*Create a site for private events

This is a part of the [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com).

**Description
You want to build a site similar to a private Eventbrite which allows users to 
create events and then manage user signups.

A user can create events. A user can attend many events. An event can be attended 
by many users. Events take place at a specific date and at a location (which you 
can just store as a string, like “Andy’s House”).
