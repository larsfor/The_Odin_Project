# README

A project as a part of The Odin Project, where we get our feet wet by making a rather simple API.
It's a "data-producing" API, meaning the controller methods wil render data instead of HTML.

If you want to try this yourself, please visit [Ruby on Rails Project: Kittens API](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-kittens-api)
