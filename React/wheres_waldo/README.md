# Where's Waldo Where's Waldo (A Photo Tagging App) 

A project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) where we're tasked at creating a photo tagging app using both Ruby on Rails (backend) and React (frontend).

A lot of inspiration has been gained from [this](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-ruby-on-rails-v7-project-with-a-react-frontend-on-ubuntu-20-04) tutorial from DigitalOcean.
