# Project: Messaging App 

In this project by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com), we're tasked with creating a messaging app using both Rails and React. At a minimum, it needs to have the following core functionality:

* Authorization
* Sending messages to another user
* Customizing a user profile

The CSS and layout is copied by this [ReactRouter tutorial](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial#adding-a-router), which is made by [Jim Nielsen](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/).

This app uses Rails 7 and React w/ Vite.

Because the app is using React as frontend, the Rails is setup as an api.
