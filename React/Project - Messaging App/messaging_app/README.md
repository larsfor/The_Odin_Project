# Project: Messaging App 

In this project by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com), we're tasked with creating a messaging app using both Rails and React. At a minimum, it needs to have the following core functionality:

* Authorization
* Sending messages to another user
* Customizing a user profile

The CSS and layout is copied by this [ReactRouter tutorial](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial#adding-a-router), which is made by [Jim Nielsen](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/).

The initial setup was heavily influenced by this [Digital Ocean tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-ruby-on-rails-v7-project-with-a-react-frontend-on-ubuntu-20-04).

This app uses Rails 7 and React.
Authorization is done through Devise.
