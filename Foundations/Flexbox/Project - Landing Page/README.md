# Project: Landing Page

Here we are tasked with recreating a homepage using an image as the main inspiration.
The idea here is to use theskills we've learned so far with Flex.
This includes among the following:
* Flex-direction
* Align-items
* Justify-content
* Flex within flex 
* Links in lists without underlines
