# A personal portfolio

This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), where we summarize what we've learnt through the Advanced HTML & CSS course.

In this project we are tasked with creating a portfolio page to show of your other projects, by using the techniques you've learned throughout this course. A point that is emphasized, is that this page should be responsive, not only for a computer screen, but also phone and tablets.

I've tried to include all the different learning points in this project, which is the following:
* A responsive page, not only for computer screens, but also smaller formats (mobile and tablet). To achive this, I've used Media Queries.
* Accessible layout, meaning that those with disabilites also have the possibilty to enjoy the web page. To achieve this, I've tried my best to use Semantic HTML, Meaningful Text and robust page navigation.
* A mix of flexbox and grid
