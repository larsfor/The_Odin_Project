# Final project: Chess

My try at making a rudimentary chess game that is played with the command line.
This is the final project at the Ruby part of the Ruby on Rails path from The Odin Project.
The project can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/ruby-final-project).

The initial set up (Display, Game and Player class) is heavily inspired by R. L. Moser's TicTacToe found [here](https://github.com/rlmoser99/ruby_TicTacToe).
