# Project: Hangman

This is a part of [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com/).
The assignment for this project can be read [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/file-i-o-and-serialization-ruby-programming).

Some of the code written here, is heavily inspired by Rachel Moser's solution for the previous project "Mastermind", found [here](https://github.com/rlmoser99/ruby_Mastermind).
