This is the final project in "Intermediate HTML and CSS Course" for The Odin Project.
The main point of this project is to create an admin dashboard using grids.

Although I wasn't able to match the "project design file", I felt that I was close enough.
I've learnt a lot of how grid works in the background, and how to nest the different elements of
the webpage for the grid to work as expected.
I've also became better in handling the different elements, such as buttons, input forms, SVGs and images.

If this sounds like something you want to try for yourself - I encourage you to visit either:
